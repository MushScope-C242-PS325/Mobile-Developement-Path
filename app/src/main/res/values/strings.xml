    <string name="poisonous_mushroom">Poisonous Mushrooms</string>
    <string name="text_poisonous_mushroom">Poisonous mushrooms are types of mushrooms that contain harmful chemical compounds that can threaten human health if consumed. These compounds, such as amatoxins, gyromitrin, or muscarine, can cause symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and serious damage to vital organs like the liver and kidneys. In some cases, consuming poisonous mushrooms can even be fatal if not treated promptly. The physical appearance of poisonous mushrooms often includes bright colors, unusual patterns, or a slimy surface, although this is not always the case. Some poisonous mushrooms resemble non-poisonous ones, making them difficult to distinguish for untrained individuals. Additionally, the aroma of poisonous mushrooms may be strong, or sometimes nearly odorless, making identification even more challenging. In such cases, knowledge or expert guidance from a mycologist is essential before deciding to consume any mushrooms found in nature.</string>
    <string name="edible_mushroom">Edible Mushrooms</string>
    <string name="text_edible_mushroom">Non-poisonous mushrooms are safe to consume and have numerous health benefits. These mushrooms are commonly used in various dishes because they are delicious and packed with nutrients such as plant protein, fiber, B vitamins, and minerals like selenium and copper. Some non-poisonous mushrooms, such as oyster mushrooms, button mushrooms, and shiitake, are widely cultivated to meet food needs. While they typically have simple appearances and neutral colors, some non-poisonous mushrooms resemble poisonous ones, making identification still important to avoid the risk of misidentification. Moreover, non-poisonous mushrooms generally grow in specific environments like decaying wood, damp soil, or piles of leaves, which are their natural habitats. With proper preparation, non-poisonous mushrooms can be a nutritious and flavorful addition to many dishes.</string>
